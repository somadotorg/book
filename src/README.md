Humanity's greatest power has been our drive to understand. This endless curiosity transformed caves into cities and revealed the laws that govern galaxies.

Artificial intelligence, if created responsibly, is a tool that helps us understand at greater levels of complexity. Just as a telescope allows us to see further, S❍MA aims to uncover patterns and connections that have remained hidden from human view.

S❍MA is a distributed system that continuously incentivizes the ingestion of new data from any source and evaluates how each contribution improves its comprehension of the world. 

In doing so, it extends humanity's greatest power: turning the unknown into understanding.


## Ways to Participate

S❍MA is built and maintained by a global community of researchers, developers, and data scientists. There are several ways to get involved:

1. **Advance Research**: Contribute to the theoretical foundations and methodologies that power SOMA's pattern recognition and knowledge synthesis
2. **Submit Data**: Help expand the network's understanding by contributing datasets and defining valuable data bounties
3. **Develop Models**: Create and improve the encoders that extract patterns from data
4. **Build Applications**: Leverage the network's intelligence to create new tools and services 
5. **Run a Node**: Participate in consensus and computation by operating network infrastructure

See the [Contributing Guide](./contributing/getting-started.md) and [Research Forum](./research/overview.md) to learn more about each path.
