Throughout history, **humanity's greatest power has been our drive to understand**. This endless curiosity transformed caves into cities and revealed the laws that govern galaxies.

Artificial intelligence is a tool that, **if created responsibly**, will help us understand at greater complexity, just as a telescope allows us see further. In this spirit, **S❍MA aims to uncover patterns and connections in knowledge that have remained hidden from human view.**

The purpose of S❍MA is to **harness this ability, continuously extracting patterns from data to build an ever more precise model of the world.**

To achieve this, S❍MA is a distributed system that **incentivizes the ingestion of new data from any source, quantifying how each contribution improves its comprehension of the world**. In doing so, it extends humanity's greatest power: turning the unknown into understanding.

## Ways to Participate

S❍MA is built and maintained by a global community of researchers, developers, and data scientists. There are several ways to get involved:

1. **Advance Research**: Contribute to the theoretical foundations and methodologies that power SOMA's pattern recognition and knowledge synthesis
2. **Submit Data**: Help expand the network's understanding by contributing datasets and defining valuable data bounties
3. **Develop Models**: Create and improve the encoders that extract patterns from data
4. **Build Applications**: Leverage the network's intelligence to create new tools and services 
5. **Run a Node**: Participate in consensus and computation by operating network infrastructure

See the [Contributing Guide](./contributing/getting-started.md) and [Research Forum](./research/overview.md) to learn more about each path.
