Humanity's greatest power has been our drive to understand. This endless curiosity transformed caves into cities and revealed the laws that govern galaxies.

Artificial intelligence, if created responsibly, is a tool that helps us understand at greater levels of complexity. Just as a telescope allows us to see further, AI should uncover patterns and connections that are hidden from human view.

S❍MA is a distributed network of computers that continuously incentivizes the ingestion of new data from any source and evaluates how each contribution improves its comprehension of the world. Anyone in the world can submit data, or develop models that extract patterns and connections. 

This endless search for novelty serves one purpose: to extend humanity's greatest legacy – our ceaseless curiosity to understand.

## Ways to Participate

S❍MA is built and maintained by a global community of researchers, developers, and data scientists. There are several ways to get involved:

1. **Advance Research**: Contribute to the theoretical foundations and methodologies that power SOMA's pattern recognition and knowledge synthesis
2. **Submit Data**: Help expand the network's understanding by contributing data
3. **Develop Models**: Create and improve the encoders that extract patterns from data
4. **Build Applications**: Leverage the network's intelligence to create new tools and services 
5. **Run a Node**: Participate in consensus by operating network infrastructure

See the [Contributing Guide](./contributing/getting-started.md) and [Research Forum](./research/overview.md) to learn more about each path.
