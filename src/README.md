Throughout history, humanity's greatest power has been our drive to understand. This endless curiosity transformed caves into cities and revealed the laws that govern galaxies.

Artificial intelligence is a tool that, if created responsibly, will help us understand at greater complexity, just as a telescope allows us see further. 

The purpose of S❍MA is to create a tool that continuously understands the world by extracting patterns in data, and seeking new data that helps it understand the world more accuractely. 

S❍MA is NOT a large language model, nor even well-suited to the task of generating text.

S❍MA is a system that incentivizes the ingestion of new data from any source, and is capable of critiquing how much the new data will contribute to S❍MA’s understanding of the world. 

Good data = more intelligence = better understanding of whether new data is valuable TODO: make this sentence cleaner but introduce the fly wheel.
