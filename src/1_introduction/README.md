Throughout history, humanity has built a shared understanding of the world. The relentless quest for knowledge has driven us towards abundance and prosperity. As AI systems promise to advance our knowledge even further, they must *accurately understand the universe.*

Embeddings are what AI models use to capture the meaning of data. Embeddings enable AI to search, generate, and understand information, translating what we know into a language that models can understand.

Creating these embeddings requires substantial energy resources, and concentrates power and knowledge in the hands of a few. Yet, the Internet has shown us that it is possible to democratize access to information and resources. **For AI to truly elevate humanity, embeddings must be as openly shared as the data on the Internet.**

**S‚ùçMA** is a shared, self-improving pool of embedding models. The system is founded on these principles:

1. **Open:** The benefits of AI‚Äôs knowledge base should be accessible and fairly shared.
2. **Continual:** AI should learn and improve at the speed of the Internet‚Äôs growth.
3. **Democratized:** Open access to embeddings will foster better research, decentralize power, and encourage a diverse range of people to bring new ideas.

Through a virtuous cycle of more data, better embeddings, and stronger incentives, S‚ùçMA aims to produce abundant knowledge for humanity.
 
Let‚Äôs get started.
